            <ul>
            <li><p>This Website is about creating awareness for a potential designer who might want to create an online shopping website which may seem like an easy process if you are very knowledgeable about coding, but in fact involves a fair amount of background research and consideration in order to gain the certain user-website relationship every website needs to become popular.</p></li>
            <br>
            <li><p>This Website is important as there are many different online shopping websites globally these days with the fact that these types of websites are still getting published especially with individual people starting their own types of online clothes selling services and without proper knowledge of how these websites work on the internet and what they must consider beofre publishing it, the website wont be attractive towrds users.</p></li>
            <br>
            <li><p>The target audeince for this website will be young adults aged from around 18 to 25 years old where this is the age students normally like to sell their clothes for extra money in which if these go to plan, are likely to grow this into a more formal based service where they buy clothes and sell them online through means of websites rather than just social media.</p></li>
            <br>
            <li><p>This website is purely intenet based and will take the position of a gateway-like of attched link to software that these young people might be using inorder to build and publish their potential online shopping websites. The link to this website wont be a barrier to entry of using the software but in fact will act purely as an awareness manual so they can get the best outcome out of their website.</p></li>
            <br>
            <li><p>I am going to approach this website by firstly reaserching how the internet works ot only generally, but how it works specifically around the netwroking world of online shopping/ecommerce based websites. I will also research how specifically online shooping website conduct their websites in order to attract people onto their website and use it more. Through this research i will summarize it and put several points and considerations as to what my poeple building online shopping website should include.</p></li>
