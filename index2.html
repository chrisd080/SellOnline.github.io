            <p>Before creating an E-commerce websites, there are several areas besides cybersecurity (the most important) that you have to consider such as readability, usability and aestheetic. What makes cybesecurity more important though is the relatisnship factor which includes the trust the user has with that websites almost like when someone enters a survey/job where they have to trust that the information they give isnt leaked or given to someone unauthorized. This could also generally be liking buying any product where people dont want to see their money wasted on soething that they cant relate to/or doesnt do its job properly in which ecommerce websites lawfully need to be able to secure peoples information. Users who feel like they cant trust the website will not use it which is why it is important to consider these <a href="https://woocurve.com/blog/7-factors-building-ecommerce-site/">points</a> </p>

                <p>With this, it is also important to create a digital certificate for your ecommerce website as this will display more obviusly to users that your ecommerce website is real as this is something that will display in the top left of your browser in boldish words so its har to miss.

    <h1>CVV Number checks and Adress Verication Systems</h1>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3CISy7aK8PE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p><a href="https://www.merchantmaverick.com/what-is-cvv2-cvv-checks/">CVV</a> numbers play an imortant role in the security of users personal information on an ecommerce website as this being on the back of a credit card means its unique to the holder of a creadit card and having a filed to input that code on a website means that its fairly impossible for a hacker to steal the credit cards information. Including a field for the input of CVV numbers are very important as this is something users may look at in the payment process if it helps assure them that the website takes interst in keeping their credit card information safe and they can purchase more comfortably and regularly.</p>

<p>Along with this, Adress Verication Systems play the (almost) compliment role in terms of the security of credit card and personal information to CVV Number checks where AVS checks the credit card holders billing information (with the company) against the billing information that was inputted into the website and this checks whther they have put the correct billing information in and have not tried to scam in any way. These are important as hackers/scammers could try a way to get out of paying for something or use this process to potentially stealpackages/money in which including this system can eliinate that factor.  </p>
